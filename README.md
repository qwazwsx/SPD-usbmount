# üåü SonicPad-Debian usbmount Configuration Script üåü

## Automatically Mount USB Devices to the Gcode Directory

This script installs [usbmount](https://github.com/rbrito/usbmount) and configures it to mount USB devices into the `~/printer_data/gcodes` directory.

### üîß **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    Clone the repository from GitHub to your `/tmp` directory:

    ```bash
    cd /tmp
    git clone https://github.com/qwazwsx/SPD-usbmount.git
    cd SPD-usbmount
    ```

2. **Run the Install Script:**

    The `install.sh` script will:
    - Install the `usbmount` package.
    - Create the necessary configuration files for `usbmount`.
    - Set up a system service to clean up symlinks during shutdown.

    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```

3. **Plug in a USB Drive**
    
    ‚ú®Observe it get automatically mounted to the `~/printer_data/gcodes/USB0` directory‚ú®

### üõ† **Customizing the Target Directory**

By default, symlinks will be created in `~/printer_data/gcodes`. To change this target directory, simply modify the `SYMLINK_DIR` variable in each of the shell scripts 
- `/etc/usbmount/mount.d/00_create_gcode_symlink`
- `/etc/usbmount/umount.d/00_remove_gcode_symlink`
- `/usr/local/bin/remove_symlinks.sh`

For example, to change the target directory:

```bash
SYMLINK_DIR="/home/sonic/custom_directory"
```

---

### üîó **Supporting Multiple Instances**

The directories for different instances are already created by the Klipper install script:

```bash
~/printer1_data/gcodes
~/printer2_data/gcodes
```

If you want one unified gcodes directory: Remove these directories and symlink them to the main `gcodes` directory:

```bash
ln -s ~/printer1_data/gcodes ~/printer_data/gcodes
ln -s ~/printer2_data/gcodes ~/printer_data/gcodes
```
This means your real gcodes directory is `~/printer_data/gcodes` and each instance's `gcodes` folder just points to that.

If you want to keep your gcodes directories seperate for each instance, just symlink the empty `~/printer_data/gcodes`, as such
> Note: The scripts will return an error if the specified directory does not exist. Ensure `~/printer_data/gcodes` exists if you are using this method.

```bash
ln -s ~/printer1_data/gcodes/USB ~/printer_data/gcodes
ln -s ~/printer2_data/gcodes/USB ~/printer_data/gcodes
```
This will create a "USB" folder in each of your instance's `gcode` folders that points to the generic `~/printer_data/gcodes` directory.
    
You can of course change the directory the symlinks appear in (from `~/printer_data/gcodes` to something else) by configuring the SYMLINK_DIR variable in the scripts. This is not recommended.

### üìù **Description of Key Scripts**

- **`00_create_gcode_symlink`**:
    - **Trigger**: When a USB device is mounted.
    - **Action**: Symlinks the specified `UM_MOUNTPOINT` to the first available `SYMLINK_DIR/USB{i}` file. Exits if a symlink already exists.

- **`00_remove_gcode_symlink`**:
    - **Trigger**: When a USB device is unmounted.
    - **Action**: Removes any symlink in `SYMLINK_DIR` that points to `UM_MOUNTPOINT`.

- **`remove_symlinks.sh`**:
    - **Trigger**: System shutdown.
    - **Action**: Removes all symlinks matching `USB*` in the specified directory.

### üìö **Logs**

- **Mount/Unmount Logs**: 
    - The script logs mount and unmount activities in `/var/log/mount_unmount.log`.
  
- **usbmount Logs**: 
    - `usbmount` logs to `/var/log/syslog` to track mounting events and system messages.

---

### üìù **Additional Notes**

- **üõ† Configure usbmount**: Ensure that `usbmount` is properly configured for your system. If needed, you can modify `usbmount`'s configuration files located at `/etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf` to add specific device types or custom mount options.
  
- **üîç Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on the logs to ensure everything is functioning as expected. You can use the following command to view live updates in the log:

    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/mount_unmount.log
    ```

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling**: If something goes wrong, the system logs will provide useful error messages. Be sure to check `/var/log/mount_unmount.log` and `/var/log/syslog` for detailed information.

- **üéâ Enjoy Seamless USB Mounting**: With everything set up, your USB devices will automatically mount to the `gcodes` directory and be easily accessible for use in your 3D printing workflow.

- **Unexpected Shutdown**: If your SonicPad unexpectedly shuts down, you may be left with extra symlinks in your gcodes directory that point to the previous USB mountpoint. Feel free to remove them.
